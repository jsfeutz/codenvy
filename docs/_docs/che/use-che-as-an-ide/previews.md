Preview objects are URLs that reference specific files or endpoints activated by your project when you run a command.  For example, you may have a command to start a Spring application server and deploy your project's artifacts into the application server. A preview object can be used to present the user with the URL of the deployed application.

Preview objects are stored as part of command. Che will generate the preview URL during the command execution and present the URL to the user as part of the command output. You can add a preview URL of any format within the command editor.
