ARTIK IDE workspaces are based on a Docker image. You can either pull that image from a public registry, like Docker Hub, or a private registry which is managed by yourself. Images in a registry can be publicly visible or private, which require user credentials to access. You can also set up a private registry to act as a mirror to Docker Hub. And, if you are running the ARTIK IDE behind a proxy, you can configure the Docker daemon registry to operate behind a proxy.
