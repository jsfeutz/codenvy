The ARTIK device and many other other embedded device have their own equivalents to the standard printed "Hello World!" program. To show that a device can interact with digital devices in the physical world a device blinks an LED to say "Hello".

This tutorial assumes that the user has already gone thru the ARTIK [Getting Started](doc:samsung-artik-ide-getting-started) documentation.

Open the ARTIK IDE in your web browser after issuing `artik-ide start`. Select `Dashboard` from the menu on the left. The will bring up the workspace and project creation interface to the right. Select `New from blank, template, or sample project`, select `Ready-to-go Stacks`, select `Artik`, name the workspace `artik`(could pick anything), change the ram to 2 GB, select the `Ready-to-run project samples` with our tutorial project `artik-blink-led`, and finally select the `Create` button either at the top right or located at the bottom.

ARTIK IDE will then start creating the workspace.

The ARTIK workspace once started will look like the following and bring up the `Manage Artik Devices` window. You will need to enter your ARTIK board ipaddress. The [Getting Started](https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/samsung-artik-ide-getting-started#5-discover-artik-device-ip-address) page has information on how to get your ARTIK device ipaddress. A quick way though is to use the following docker CLI `docker run jdrummond/artik-tools -q -t 5 -i <ip-address-on-network>`. If more than one ipaddress is found, remove `-q` and try again. If a ipaddress is not found, make sure your ARTIK device is on with 3 leds on next to ANT3, connected to a network via wired/wireless and make sure you <ip-address-on-network> used is on the same network as your ARTIK device.

Close the `Manage Artik Devices` window once the connection has been made.

Click the drop down `CMD` menu located to the left of the blue play button. Select `artik-blink-led: build` from the drop down menu. Click the drop down menu `Targets` just to the left and select the `default` target. Hit the blue play button to run the `artik-blink-led: build` command. A tab will appear in the `Processes` area at the bottom. There will be no output from this command but don't worry it did create the assembly/binary file that can be used on the ARTIK device.

The build creates a file called `a.out` in the projects root directory. In order to see the new file click the `artik-blink-led` root directory in the `Project Explorer` on the left then click the `refresh` button at the top right. Once this is done you will be able to see the `a.out` file. Right click on the `a.out` file and select from the drop down menu `Push To Device > artik_device_1`. A green popup should come up indicated the success of the push and the location of the `a.out` on the ARTIK device which by default is `/root`.

![artik-blink-led-8.jpg](../../docs/imgs/artik-blink-led-8.jpg)
Let's check to make sure our ARTIK device has our new `a.out` assembly file. Click the `terminal` button command in the `Processes` area next to the ARTIK target. Once open issue command `ls /root` on the ARTIK device terminal. You should be able to see the `a.out` file listed in the ARTIK device `/root` folder.
![artik-blink-led-9.jpg](../../docs/imgs/artik-blink-led-9.jpg)
Now lets run `a.out` assembly on the ARTIK device. Select `Edit Commands ...` from the drop down `CMD` menu. Hit the `+` button next to `CUSTOM` to create a new command. Name the command `artik-blink-led: run` and enter `/root/a.out` for the command line. Hit the `save` button of the bottom right then close window. Next click the target window and select the target `artik_device_1`. This will make our new command `artik-blink-led: run` execute on the ARTIK device NOT in the workspace.

Place an LED into between pin 13 and `GND`(newer ARTIK device models) or `Vref`(older ARTIK device models) depending on your model of ARTIK board. Refer to [Blink an LED](https://developer.artik.io/documentation/tutorials/blink-an-led.html) tutorial on ARTIK's documentation page for additional information. The image below shows the LED plugged into the newer model using the pin 13 and `GND`.
