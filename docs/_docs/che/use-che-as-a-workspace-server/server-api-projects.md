Che provides developer services within a workspace server whose project type and edit-build-run cycle can be customized. Product teams can deliver on-demand workspaces for their user-developers through the Che IDE or another. In this section we describe API and services that make Che act as a workspace server.

# Definition
In Che a **Project** is an instance of a Project Type with concrete values for all attributes and a set of associated Source Code that resides within the Projectâ€™s file system.
```curl  
# Get workspace id
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workspace

# Create the project
